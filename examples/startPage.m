%% MACO(DE) - The Magnetic Configuration (Designer) Toolbox
% With this fancy named toolbox, you'll be able to work with magnetic
% configuration in a consistent way! The idea behind this package is that
% you should be able to define a magnetic configuration using clear and
% understandable concepts, while avoiding chances to make errors, say mix
% up signs, by handing over repetitive tasks to a "standarized" system.
%
% This (fancy named) toolbox provides
%
% * Classes defining currents and their magnetic properties
% * A magnetic configuration class combining the effects of multiple
% currents, and acting as an interface to query basic magnetic equilibrium
% properties.
% * Helper functions to compute more complex properties
% * Examples showing you how to get started (before you break anything) !

% Using the left pane, you can browse through the documentation using
% MATLAB(R)'s built-in browser. Especially for functions, you might however
% prefer to browse their help directly using either the <matlab:doc('doc')
% doc> or  <matlab:doc('help') help> commands!
