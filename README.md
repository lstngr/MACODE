# Negative Triangularity - GBS
## What's this?
A set of functions and classes (aka. toolbox) for MATLAB(R). It aims at
computing magnetic equilibria for Tokamak reactors. This specific toolbox is
targeted to be used alongside the GBS code when implementing new
magnetic configurations.

The code is targeted to work with releases of MATLAB(R) starting R2015a.
## How do I get the code in MATLAB?
**TODO** - Check if this section stays accurate

You can either

- Install the toolbox by opening the toolbox file with MATLAB(R) or,
- Navigate to the Git repository within MATLAB(R)

From here, run `NegTriSetup('MakeDocs',true)`, which will generate the
documentation of the code on your workstation. Once this is done, the folder
should be in the path and you should be set.

## How do I use this code?
The code is documented aaccordingly within MATLAB(R). You can start by
querying the `Contents.m` of the package, or browse the HTML documentation using
MATLAB(R)'s `doc` command (look under *Supplemental Software*).

Demonstration scripts are also available using the `demo` command, or from
MATLAB(R)'s web browser (see previous paragraph).
